#Sorry for the inconvenience, but the project is renamed to livecss. And the new project page is at https://github.com/a-sk/livecss


#Introduction:
This Script underlays the hexadecimal, rgb or named CSS color codes with their real color.
The foreground color is selected oppositely.

#Featuers:
1. On-the-fly colorizing
2. Colorizing/uncolorizing using ST commands

#Limitations:
1. Due to limitation of current ST API
it colorizes regions by creating theme file.
2. Still in alpha, so may be full of bugs.
3. It assumes all theme are in `Packages/Color Scheme - Default folder` folder
